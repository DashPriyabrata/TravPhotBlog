        <p>
          My friends call me Dash. As a kid I wanted to be a doctor but ended up becoming an engineer and life made me a traveler:)
          I started my travel journey as a biker wandering the Western Ghats in south India, thanks to my riding buddies and the people who inspired me to go places without thinking much.
          I stopped riding motorcycle in 2016 due to professional commitments etc. but never stopped traveling. I work as an engineer always looking for an opportunity to explore new places near or far!
        </p>

        <p class="sayit_mb_140 sayit_sm_mb_80">
          When exploring a new place, I try my best to move around like a local using buses and public transport which later I put on my blogs as I experience it.
          Of-coure I get both pleasant & unpleasant experiences in my journies but hey that's what we call traveling right! Offbeat places are my fav since I find less tourists & more travelers at these places.
          I love natural and kaleidoscopic landscapes which inspired me to try my hands on photography, as a result you'll find some quality clicks in my blogs.
          If you love Traveling/Photography/Blogging/Motorcycling, youâ€™ll feel right at home here. I love to share things as I discover them.

                  I try to spend minimal time on social media platforms to give more time to my real life. But that doesn't mean I'm slow on attending messages on these platforms.
